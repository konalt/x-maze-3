# X-Maze 3
A command-line maze game.
## Build instructions
Step 1: Install [https://www.npmjs.com/package/nexe](nexe) using `npm i -g nexe`.
   * You may need [https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools](windows-build-tools), get them with `npm i -g windows-build-tools`

Step 2: Run the command `nexe main -t <windows/macos/linux> --build`
   * It may need to compile node.js first, if you haven't already. This took about 40 minutes for me

Step 3: You have your X-Maze 3 EXE! It should be in the same directory as main.js.
